                        <h1>
                            Hello there! My name is Hiram and welcome to my
                            addiction recovery journal.
                        </h1>
                        <p>
                            I don't know about you, but I'm tired of wasting so
                            many hours looking at things I shouldn't be at the
                            computer. Join me as I explore the depths of how I
                            got to that point, what I can do about it, and
                            finally how to achieve lasting freedom.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div id="about-detail">
                    <h2>How it all began</h2>
                    <p>I remember the night like it was yesterday.</p>
                    <p>
                        When the love of my life, the one who I was going to
                        build a life and family with, slammed the door on me.
                        Deep down I knew why. This was going to be the last
                        time, I promise!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And yet, for reasons I couldn't fathom, I did it
                        again...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There I was, in the aftermath of yet another relapse
                        when she walked in, took one look at the devastation,
                        and simply began packing her bags. I didn't try and stop
                        her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, I do my utmost to honour her memory, and to mourn
                        the life we could've had together.
                    </p>
                    <h2>How I stay committed to the path</h2>
                    <p>
                        The first way I remain on the path is described above,
                        because if I want anything it's not to go through that
                        again! Should I be fortunate to find another sweetheart,
                        the last thing I want to do is drive her away.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Secondly, I want to use this journal as a way of
                        uncovering unconscious patterns that regularly escape my
                        attention. I want to master my mind, so that it doesn't
                        master me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, I think of all the people and their potential
                        trapped by the same demons I'm facing. The best way to
                        learn something is to teach it!
                    </p>
